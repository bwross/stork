Introduction
============

Stork is a data transfer scheduler that manages and optimizes the movement of
data across arbitrary endpoints in a protocol-agnostic manner. Stork also
provides interfaces for browsing and organizing data on remote endpoints, as
well as command line and browser clients for interacting with the system.

Stork uses client—server approach to scheduling data transfer jobs. Clients
submit jobs to a Stork server and the Stork server performs the transfer when
resources permit. The transfer happens asynchronously to the client, allowing
users to go along their merry way and check on the status of the job at their
own leisure. The Stork server responds to any failures that may occur during
transfer automatically, handling them in an appropriate way and informing the
user if a job can't be completed.

Stork plug-ins can be created to add support for new file transfer protocols
very easily (with any programming language, too) using a simple external
executable interface. If additional performance or integration with the Stork
server is desired, plug-ins can also be written in Java and extend the built-in
`TransferModule` class, eliminating the communication overhead of piping
serialized messages between Stork and the transfer module.

Supported Platforms
===================

Stork is intended to run in any Java Virtual Machine with the Java SE 7 runtime
on any modern operating system. In reality it's only been tested with the
OpenJDK 7 JRE on Linux, though there's no reason to believe it couldn't work on
any other JVM.

Prerequisites
=============

Stork requires a Java SE 7 compatible runtime and development kit, along with
the utilities that typically come packaged with them (e.g., the `jar` command).
Note that you will require both the JDK and the JRE.

How this is done depends on the system you are building Stork on and your
preferred Java SE 7 implementation. For example, to install OpenJDK 7 on a
system based on Debian Linux, such as Ubuntu, you would do:

    apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk openjdk-7-jre

The following libraries are required as well:

* Apache Commons Logging 1.1
* Log4J 1.2.13
* JGlobus 1.8.0
* Netty 4.0.0
* JSch 0.1.50

Running Stork using the startup script in `bin` currently requires Bash.  In a
future release, this script will be cleaned up a bit to be more portable
between shells. If you do not have Bash installed, running the following
command after building effectively does what the script does:

    java -cp 'lib/*' stork.Stork <command> [args]

This section will be formalized bit later. For now, the necessary libraries are
included in the repository.

Building
========

On most systems, simply run `make` (specifically `gmake`) or another GNU Make
compatible Make utility. For systems without a Make command installed, the
entire source tree can be found under the `stork` directory.  Running `javac`
on all of it, putting the resulting class files in a JAR file, and putting that
in `lib` effectively accomplishes what `make` does.

Documentation can be generated by running `make doc`, and will be put in the
`doc` directory.

Installation
============

Right now there's no automatic installation. There will be, just not right now.
If you want to install Stork system-wide, after building you can copy this
entire directory wherever you want (perhaps `/usr/local/stork/` if you're using
a FHS'y system) and either making a symlink to `bin/stork` somewhere in your
system executable path or manually setting your executable path to including
the `bin` directory in your Stork installation path.

Commands
========

* `stork server` — Used to start a Stork server. Right now it just outputs
  everything to the command line until proper daemonization and automatic
  process killing with a PID file is supported. The server may be run in the
  background by passing the `-d` option, e.g.: `stork server -d`
* `stork q` — List all the jobs in the Stork queue along with information about
  them, such as their status and progress. Can be used to find information
  about specific jobs by passing a job ID. Can also be used to filter jobs by
  their status.
* `stork submit` — Submit a job to a Stork server. Can be passed a source and
  destination URL, a text file containing one or more jobs, or no arguments to
  read jobs from standard input.
* `stork rm` — Cancel or terminate a submitted job or set of jobs.
* `stork info` — Display configuration information about the server.  Can also
  be used to find information about transfer modules.
* `stork ls` — List a remote URL.
* `stork user` — Login to a Stork server or register as a new user.

More information can be found by running `stork --help`.

Configuring
===========

The Stork configuration file (stork.conf) can be used to change settings for
the server and client tools. The search order for the configuration file is as
follows:

1. $STORK\_CONFIG
2. ~/.stork.conf
3. /etc/stork.conf
4. $STORK/stork.conf
5. /usr/local/stork/stork.conf
6. stork.conf in currect directory

Even if the file can't be found automatically, every valid config
variable has a default value. The Stork server will issue a warning
on startup if a config file cannot be found.

How to Use
==========

Start a Stork server, unless you plan on using an existing server.  Submit a
job to the server using `stork submit`. Upon submission, the job will be
assigned a job ID which `stork submit` will output. Run `stork q all` to view
all jobs and look for the job you submitted.  You can use `stork rm` to cancel
the job. You can run `stork info` to see additional information about a server,
such as what protocols it supports.

Every Stork command honors the `--help` option, which will cause it to display
usage information. Run, e.g., `stork submit --help` to see detailed information
on how to use the submit command.

Talking to Stork
================

Stork accepts job descriptors in a number of simple key-value pair
formats, including JSON and (simple) Condor ClassAd.

An example job descriptor in the JSON format:

    {
      "src"  : "ftp://example.com/file1.txt",
      "dest" : "ftp://example.com/file2.txt",
      "max_attempts" : 5,
      "email" = "user@example.com"
    }

The same job descriptor in the ClassAd format:

    [
      src  = "ftp://example.com/file1.txt";
      dest = "ftp://example.com/file2.txt";
      max_attempts = 5;
      email = "user@example.com"
    ]

When reading job descriptors from a file using `stork submit` the
opening and closing brackets may be omitted.

Stork is very liberal with what formats it accepts, and can receive
jobs in various formats with similar grammars to JSON/ClassAd, though
with weird combinations of symbols. How weird exactly? Weird enough
that the same parser understands both JSON and ClassAd. The parser can
be found in `stork/ad/AdParser.java` if you're curious exactly what you
can throw at this thing.

More information about JSON and HTCondor ClassAd can be found here:

Compatibility with HTCondor
===========================

Stork has some history as a component in the HTCondor distributed
computing system, and with that being the case we've made some effort
to maintain compatibility with HTCondor components that interfaced with
previous Stork versions.

The following line can be added to the `stork.conf` file to enable
compatibility mode for legacy components expecting a specific output
format from Stork commands:

    condor_mode = true

Additional legacy support features are planning, including DAGMan
logging output.

Project Structure
=================

* `bin/` — Contains scripts to execute JARs. This directory gets included in
  the release tarfile for a binary release.
* `build/` — Gets created when the project is built. Contains all class files
  generated by the Java compiler. Everything in here then gets put into
  stork.jar after building.
* `doc/` — Contains documentation after running `make doc`.
* `lib/` — Contains external libraries that get included in stork.jar on build.  
* `libexec/` — Stork searches here for transfer module binaries when it is run.
  Gets included in the binary release tarfile.
* `stork/` — Includes all the Java source files for Stork.
* `Makefile` — Contains all the build rules for `make`. You can manually
  configure some options for Stork here.
* `README.md` — Contains instructions on how to use Stork. Gets included in the
  binary release tarfile.
